Last updated: September 2025

This policy explains how Wally collects, uses, shares, and protects data. It is provided for convenience only and is not legal advice.

Who We Are & Scope  
Wally is an app for EV charging information and related services, including peer-to-peer (P2P) features between users. This policy applies to your use of the app and related services.

Israeli Legal Framework (Summary)  
• Basic Laws: Privacy protections derive from the Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty.  
• Applicable law: the Protection of Privacy Law, 5741-1981 (and regulations), overseen by Israel’s Privacy Protection Authority (Ministry of Justice).  
• Upcoming reform: Amendment 13 (expected to take effect August 2025) enhances enforcement and transparency, and may require appointing a Data Protection Officer (DPO) for certain organizations.

What Data We Collect  
We collect only what is necessary to operate and improve the service:  
• Account data (name, email, account IDs).  
• Location (GPS) to show stations and navigation—with your consent.  
• User-submitted content (e.g., price updates, P2P listing descriptions).  
• Technical/usage data (device model/OS, device identifiers, IP for security/diagnostics).  
• Communications with us (support, feedback) and records of consent.

Purposes & Legal Bases  
• Provide and operate the service (performance of a contract).  
• Navigation and mapping (separate consent for location permissions).  
• Security, fraud prevention, and service integrity (legitimate interests and legal obligations).  
• Improvements and aggregated/anonymous analytics (legitimate interests).  
• Service communications and important updates (contract/legitimate interests).

Sharing with Third Parties  
We share only what is necessary to operate the service, under contracts and confidentiality:  
• Infrastructure and hosting (e.g., Firebase/Firestore, hosting, security).  
• Mapping and geocoding providers (OSM/Nominatim/Waze) when you use those features.  
• Analytics in aggregated/anonymous form.  
• Compliance with law, court orders, or competent authorities.

International Transfers  
Data may be processed/stored on servers outside Israel. We use contractual and technical safeguards as appropriate.

Data Retention  
We retain data only as needed to provide the service, comply with law, resolve disputes, and improve. Real-time location is not retained beyond what is required to render the feature.

Your Rights under Israeli Law  
Subject to law, you may have rights such as:  
• Access to your personal data.  
• Rectification, update, or deletion of inaccurate data.  
• Restriction or objection to processing in certain cases.  
To exercise rights: use Settings → Feedback or contact support in-app. Identity verification may be required.

Children’s Privacy  
The service is not intended for children under 16. If we learn of improper use, we will take appropriate deletion steps.

Security  
We implement reasonable organizational and technical safeguards; however, no method is 100% secure.

Limitation of Liability (“As Is”)  
The service is provided “as is” and without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including accuracy, availability, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. Wally is not liable for any indirect, consequential, special, or punitive damages (including lost profits, data, or use) arising from use of the service—even if advised of the possibility. Subject to mandatory law, our total liability is limited to the amount you paid for the service (if any) during the three months preceding the event.  
User-generated content (including charging/fuel prices, P2P listings, and navigation cues) is not verified and does not constitute a commitment by Wally. Interactions between users are solely their responsibility.

Changes to this Policy  
We may update this policy from time to time. We will display an in-app notice and update the “Last updated” date above. Your continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.

Governing Law  
This policy is governed by the laws of the State of Israel, subject to any mandatory law. Exclusive jurisdiction—competent courts in Tel Aviv–Yafo, to the extent permitted.

Contact  
For privacy questions or requests, use Settings → Feedback in the app and we will respond promptly.
